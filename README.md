## Introduction
This is pygame project made in python, and I believe it to be one of, if not one of the best project I've ever worked on and I love it. I love every part of it and it really amazes me how far I've come as a Developer and programer.
I feel like I've done so good with this project, because I'm trying to eliminate most of AI tools and really make it myself. It taught me so much not using AI like a maniac trying to find the solution.
I've had some projects that were really hard so I just passed it to Chat-GPT and he just made it for me. But then I've realised that this is wrong. I didn't learn much during the process, just mindlesley typing prompts and "trying" to understand the code.

To every Dev out there, just make stuff. It calms your brain in a way you've never expirienced. As of right now, I'm enjoying the process of writing this README file and that is just crazy to me.
Make anything you want and start small. Small wins are very good, it tracks progress wery well

## How does it work?
look into ![TODO.txt](https://github.com/Bate12/Grid-system-pygame/blob/main/TODO.txt) where you'll find the progress of the game so far and maybe some more upcomming changes

It is basically a tile system where each tile has an Angle and with that angle it creates those small little rectangles that spin around in a loop.
### There are all sort of Algorithms some examples:
 - converting image into a list of colors
 - uploading data to cashe files with threading
 - from a path to a image file / folder, it grabs colors from images
 - UI elements with onHover animations, Text and more
 - drag and drop Image / Folder files onto the screen (this one I'm very proud of)
### and much more

## What will be next?
I'm trying to make a good product, but soon enough I'll be uploading my program hopefully in a few days or so from now, right inow is 18.9.2025
This comes with a version of v0.1 and later I want to add much more while still not using ai that much, only for mundane tasks
Also, I will maybe consider uploading to ich.io or any other forums
